# Overview

I developed a C# console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other in a turn-based format. The program includes a menu system, input validation, game state management, and a persistent leaderboard that saves player statistics between program runs using a CSV file.

I wrote this software with the main goal of becoming more familiar with C# syntax and furthering my understanding of object-oriented programming. Through this project, I became more comfortable with the language’s structure and with organizing code by dividing responsibilities across multiple classes.

# Future Work

- Implement a GUI to replace the console-based interface. 
- Add a single-player mode. 

# AI Disclosure

- I used ChatGPT as a learning and reference tool throughout this project to help think through design approaches, clarify C# syntax, and review pseudocode ideas. I primarily used AI to expand my understanding of language syntax and available constructs, while ensuring all final code reflects my own understanding.
